# Overview
This is a basic URL shortener made for the C4C coding challenge.

### Changes I've made
If the link submitted was invalid, the shortener will state that the given link was invalid rather than sending the shortened link.

### Improvements
- Display all previously shortened links in the database
- Add further testing
- Give the option to delete shortened links from the database
